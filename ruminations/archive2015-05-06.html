  <h3>When an SSD drive goes bad.</h3>
<p>So, that was exciting. One of our Physicists, Sean Frigo, wasn't able to get into his laptop. He would log in about a quarter of the way through the decryption/login, the machine would crash. This happened with the admin account, too. I went into recovery mode and it said the disk needed repairs. (This is a MacBook Pro by the way.)</p>

<p>Well, there were potentially unsaved data, which I was able to pull onto a USB drive. In hindsight, this is a pretty boring topic. Let's move onto another one. I'm trying to figure out git on the Mac.</p>

<h3>And on to using version control - Git</h3>
<p>I should have been using version control for a while, but setting it up can be a pain. I don't want to make something visible to the world, especially since some of it might include sensitive data. I've used Subversion in the past but it seems that Git is the big thing these days. So that's what I'm doing.</p>

<p>So far this seems pretty straight forward. I'm not sure where the actual repository is, but this thing is noticing revisions. The question is, what happens when this syncs with my laptop? Will Home Sync barf on the hidden folders? We'll see.</p>

<p>Let's see how this works with symbolic links. Instead of moving index.php and recreating it all the time, I'm going to have everything cecinestpasunewordpress on an archive file and create a symbolic link to the latest one. I guess the thing to do next would be to have a list of the archives along the side.</p>
