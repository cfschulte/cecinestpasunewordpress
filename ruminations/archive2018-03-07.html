  <h3>Reworking a Database</h3>
  
  <p>I need to convert a poorly designed Access database into a flexible, web-based, mysql database. When I say "poorly designed," I'm talking about tables accessing fields from one table that are not un-ambiguous. For instance "Vendor" is accessed by the name of the vendor. "That is the primary key." Of course the spelling is usually different than what's in the database. And they glom a lot of information that they would like to relate to other information into these horrible large text fields &mdash; that they want to be split up.</p>
  
  <p>I thought I had a pretty good thing worked out, but the user wanted all kinds of things to link up that usually don't now. They also wanted unlimited undos, automatic saving. The crazy thing is, I think I've got it &mdash; At least for now.</p>
