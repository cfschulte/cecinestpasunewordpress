  <h3>Rethinking the layout</h3>
  <p>It looks like I should rethink this. These static files are getting hard to manage. Every little idea for a refresh requires a an update to multiple files. And I'm not even very far along. Anyway, just for the sake of "that's what all the cool kids do," I should store straight text in a sql database.</p>
  
  <p>This text editor has a feature that will automatically balance ones quotation marks: double and single (apostrophe). That gets problematic when you're using contractions and showing possession. But it's handy sometimes so I currently keep bbedit's preference panel open when I'm doing this. Not that you care.</p>
  
  <p>My brain is bouncing. I've got what Jean-Louis Gass√©e called "Monkey Brains" in a recent <a href="https://mondaynote.com/ten-years-of-monday-notes-645734e25cdd">Monday Note</a>. "Picture a cage filled with monkeys shrieking and jumping from bar to bar." The latest news of our good ole USofA is that there was yet <i>another</i> mass shooting. This one in Parkland, Florida. That makes 30 this year. It is mid February. There is not much that I can say that hasn't been said before.</p>
  
  <p>We are at a point where rational discourse is not an option. We must get enough people to simply say to the gun rights advocates, "that's it! Your opinion no longer matters." Then change the laws. Given the way our electorate works, I don't think that's possible through the normal democratic process. I think we need to find a way to make lawsuits happen.</p>
  
  <p>Bill Clinton was able to fight tobacco in the `90s with lawsuits. The lobbies were too powerful and the lawmakers just wouldn't let that happen. Class action lawsuits started to put financial pressure on the right groups and things changed. It would be nice if we could sue the lawmakers directly, but my attorney brother-in-law told me there are reasons you can't - something about whether or not the government can hire a third party to take the responsibility. That's why you can sue the state if you're hurt on an unsafe road.</p>
  
  <p>But why can't you sue the NRA? Whenever something like this happens, the families of the slain should given multi-million dollar payouts and the living victims should be able to sue for the trauma they suffered. </p>
