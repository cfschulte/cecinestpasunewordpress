   <H3>Testing the best way to get away from MS Word</h3>
   <p>There is no reason for MS Word to take up so much space. All of the formatting that it does can be achieved through normal markup tags. </p>
   
   <p>So, what are the clever things I want to write about these days? Religion (or lack thereof), politics, etc. are pretty much covered by other people, and they do it much eloquently than I could. I do have an idea for a science fiction story that I would like to play with. And of course, there is the ever interesting world of html/php development.</p>
   
   <p>One thing about HTML vs MS Word is that you can actually write math in html - somewhat. First, I will need to install MathJax. </p>
   
   <p>So now we're looking at something called Nagios to monitor and manage our network. I'm still studying this so there isn't a lot to say at the moment.</p>
