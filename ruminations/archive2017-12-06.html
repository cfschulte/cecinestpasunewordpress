  <h3>Is this a proto-blog?</h3>
  
  <p>I've been playing with the idea of doing a little website on the side. My idea is to do some kind of written content along with experiments in javascript, css, html5, and php. Maybe even a little python and ruby. I should start playing with scss and all that. Use node.js and all that too.
  </p>
<p>The problem with the written content is that there is nothing I really want to talk about anymore. Anything to say about the political situation has been said - over and over again.</p>

<p>One thing I need to do is update my nav page. The old cfs has got to go but it is so comfortable right now. I know were everything is. When I'm not sure what I need to do, I check in on my homepage. I need to overhaul the homepage.</p>
