  <h2>So it's monday</h2>
  
  <p>I got to work this morning and before my official arrival time of 8:00 am, I had to unjam a printer/copier and help someone remember his password. Matt couldn't come in because he had to watch the kids, but that's OK. It's good to feel useful with the little things that I can figure out without a whole lot of brain power. </p>
    
    <p>We had a yard sale/estate sale last Saturday. That in itself is not real exciting, but I needed some place to start, so I'll start there. Natalie's mother died a year and a half ago and now we have her furniture in our garage. The whole thing just feels weird. We both still get upset thinking about Marcella. She went from this perfectly normal, functioning, working woman, about to retire and spend her time partying and doting on her grandchildren, to an almost immobile, incoherent mass on a hospice bed in only a few months.</p>
    
    <p>Brain cancer. That's just frightening. At least my friend, Mike Ball, was pretty lucid when died of bile duct cancer last December. He was able to say goodbye to his friends and family, sharing laughter and cups of coffee with us only a couple of weeks before he left. It was still very hard, though.</p>
    
    <p>The thing that gets me is just how quickly and unexpectedly this all goes. I work with radiation oncologists and they don't seem to talk about it too much. I've asked a few questions, but I always feel like I'm being annoying and should just shut up about it. I would love to be in a position where I could do some kind of scientific programming or data mining to help with this research, but as always, you need particular credentials to do that sort of thing.</p>
    
    <p>Ho hum.</p>
    
    <p>Later:</p>
    
    <p>So, I just watched the Apple WWDC Keynote event. I don't really have a use for a lot of the stuff they were showing there, but I still get excited about using some of those programming tools, even though I don't really have a use for them. I work through tutorials, and they help, at least a little bit, but then I try to do something completely by myself and I'm lost. Working with Swift now. I guess just knowing how to cast an Int to an Int64 and vice versa is important.</p>
